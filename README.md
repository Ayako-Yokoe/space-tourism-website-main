## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this project, I followed Scrimba's free course. I tried to stick to the instructions instead of applying my own methods so I could learn modern coding styles and understand how professional developers work. It took some time for me to grasp everything, but I gained a clear understanding in the end and realized how powerful custom CSS can be when used throughout a project.

```css
.flex {
  display: flex;
  gap: var(--gap, 1rem);
}

.tab-list {
  --gap: 2rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I'll continue practicing these newly learned coding patterns. First, I'll revisit my previous project and apply them to deepen my understanding.
